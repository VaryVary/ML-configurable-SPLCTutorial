# Tutorial "Machine Learning and Software Configurable Systems: A Gentle Introduction" 

## Material 

Slides: see google drive folder 

 * Motivation: Why machine learning is relevant for engineering software configurable systems? 
 * Overview: An overview of works in the field
   * based on a systematic literature survey
   * we describe the different applications (pure prediction, optimization, specialization, understanding, etc.)
   * we review subject systems and application domains 
   * we describe numerous sampling strategies 
   * we detail how configurations are measured 
   * we report on learning algorithms used and their assessment 
 * Practical session 1: learning-based specialization with VaryLaTeX case
  * information about VaryLaTeX: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01659161/ https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/varylatex
  * dataset: https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/varylatex/blob/master/output-FSE/csvs/
  * decision tree and a focus on interpretability 
  * we use Python and Jupyter notebooks 
    * R solution is also available https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/varylatex/blob/master/output-FSE/analysisCT.R for the interested audience 
 * Practical session 2: performance prediction with x264 case
  * dataset from the literature  
  * we use Python and Jupyter notebooks 
 * Summary and open research directions 
   * wrap-up
